# Laboratory Work 9

# Description
This project involves the following tasks:
 
1. Graphical User Interface for Computational Problem Solving
This project aims to develop a simple graphical interface for solving computational problems and implement a Java program to handle its functionality. The interface should include a program window (frame), text fields for inputting data, a field to display the result, and a button to initiate the computation (refer to the example execution).

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
