# Laboratory Work 8

# Description
This project involves the following tasks:
 

1. Implement a program that writes a sequence of random numbers to a file (in the txt format) within the range specified by command-line parameters. The filename is also provided as a command-line parameter. The program should check if the file with the specified name exists and create it if it doesn't exist before writing to the file.
To generate a random number within the range [b1, b2], you can use the formula new Random().nextInt(b2 - b1 + 1) + b1.

2. Read the information from the file created in the previous task and display it on the console.








## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
